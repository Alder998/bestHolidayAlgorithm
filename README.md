Best Holiday Algorithm

here to go on holiday this summer? My friends and me were really confuse. Therefore I created a simple algorithm that scrape the data from AirBnB Experiences
and from AirBnB housing prices. We do not know which place is better, and therefore an "Artificial" Train set is created with a K-Means. 
Then, it all becomes a Classification task.I chose a simple Logistic Model. The probabilities of being the right places is plotted on a final Map from a Plotly link.
